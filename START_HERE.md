# Quick Start Guide - ConsentManager

## System Status

ConsentManager is deployed and operational.

**Live Demo:**
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/consent-manager-cdn-tanapatj-jkt/index.html
```

---

## Database Requirements

### Client-Side Operation

The consent manager operates entirely client-side. User preferences are stored in the browser as a cookie (`cm_cookie`).

**Not Required:**
- Backend server
- Database
- API
- User accounts
- Logging system (unless analytics needed)

**Default Behavior:** The library handles all consent management automatically:
1. Shows banner on first visit
2. Saves user choice to browser cookie
3. Blocks tracking scripts until user accepts
4. Remembers choice on future visits

**This is already GDPR compliant!** ✅

Integration code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- 1. Add CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/consent-manager-cdn-tanapatj-jkt/v1.0.0/consent-manager.css">
</head>
<body>
    
    <!-- Website content -->
    
    <!-- 2. Add JavaScript -->
    <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/consent-manager-cdn-tanapatj-jkt/v1.0.0/consent-manager.umd.js"></script>
    
    <!-- 3. Initialize -->
    <script>
        ConsentManager.run({
            categories: {
                necessary: { readOnly: true, enabled: true },
                analytics: {},
                marketing: {}
            },
            language: {
                default: 'en',
                translations: {
                    en: {
                        consentModal: {
                            title: 'We use cookies',
                            description: 'This website uses cookies to enhance the browsing experience.',
                            acceptAllBtn: 'Accept all',
                            acceptNecessaryBtn: 'Reject all',
                            showPreferencesBtn: 'Manage preferences'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**That's it!** Open in browser and the cookie banner appears. ✅

## 🔒 Block Tracking Scripts (GDPR Compliance)

**Before (NOT compliant - runs immediately):**
```html
<script>
    ga('send', 'pageview');  // ❌ Runs without consent!
</script>
```

**After (GDPR compliant - blocked until consent):**
```html
<script data-category="analytics" type="text/plain">
    ga('send', 'pageview');  // ✅ Only runs if user accepts!
</script>
```

**Key:** Add `data-category="analytics"` and `type="text/plain"` to tracking scripts.
